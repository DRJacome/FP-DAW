00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.009
To be or not to be.<br> That is the question.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.512
Oh! Excuse me.<br> Hello, and welcome.

00:00:11.163 --> 00:00:13.294
My name is Big Buck Bunny.

00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.324
Indeed, you might know me from<br> such films as, Big Buck Bunny.

00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:23.824
Welcome to my home; now just make yourself<br> comfortable while I open this book.

00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:28.498
My friends, let me tell you a sad but true story:

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.346
Did you ever ask yourself what happened to all those loveable characters

00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:38.030
 you used to see on the big screen when you where growing up?

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:43.506
No matter what they might have told you in the movies.<br> They didn't live happily ever after.

00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:48.497
In fact, and as awful as this may sound, many of them were locked away

00:00:48.717 --> 00:00:52.673
 in the deep dark dungeons of mount Copyright,

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:57.603
 only to be guarded by the terrible beasts we call "lawers".

00:00:58.402 --> 00:01:00.067
Unlike many of my friends...
